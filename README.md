</div>

Filadex is an open-source filament management system for 3D printing enthusiasts. Born from the need for a comprehensive solution to track and manage 3D printing filaments, Filadex offers a clean, intuitive interface for monitoring your filament inventory, usage statistics, and storage information. This project is fully AI-coded, showcasing the potential of AI-assisted development in creating practical, user-friendly applications.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- PostgreSQL (v12 or higher) or SQLite (embedded, no separate server needed)
- Docker & Docker Compose (optional, for containerized deployment)

## 🚀 Installation

### Option 1: Local Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/filadex.git
cd filadex
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Set up environment variables**

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
# For PostgreSQL:
DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/filadex

# Or for SQLite:
# DATABASE_URL=file:./dev.db
```

4. **Initialize the database**

```bash
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:init
```

5. **Start the development server**

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:5000

### Option 2: Docker Deployment

Choose between PostgreSQL (multi-user default) and SQLite (single-user). Note that there is **no migration path** between the two engines in either direction — a deployer picks once:

#### Variant A: PostgreSQL (Default)

1. Copy the PostgreSQL template:
   ```bash
   cp docker-compose.template.yml docker-compose.yml
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Start the containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

#### Variant B: SQLite (Single-User, No External DB Container)

1. Copy the SQLite template:
   ```bash
   cp docker-compose.sqlite.template.yml docker-compose.yml
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Start the container:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

Database files and backups are persisted inside the `filadex_data` volume: the database at `/data/filadex.db` and scheduled snapshots in `/data/backups` (override with `BACKUP_DIR`). SQLite runs with write-ahead logging (WAL), producing `-wal` and `-shm` files beside the database, which is why external backups should copy the entire `/data` directory rather than copying a single `.db` file.

The application will be available at http://localhost:8080.
 
#### Variant C: Synology NAS (Container Manager with SQLite)

For a complete step-by-step guide on deploying Filadex on a Synology NAS using Container Manager, HTTPS reverse proxy, automated SQLite backups, and persistent storage, see [`docs/deployment-synology.md`](docs/deployment-synology.md) and [`docker-compose.synology.yml`](docker-compose.synology.yml).

## 🔧 Configuration

### Database Configuration

Filadex supports PostgreSQL and SQLite:

```env
# PostgreSQL:
DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/filadex

# SQLite:
DATABASE_URL=file:/data/filadex.db
```

When using SQLite, an admin-only **DB Backups** panel appears in Settings with on-demand snapshot creation, download, and automated scheduled backups (daily or weekly) with configurable retention pruning.


### Application Configuration

You can configure various aspects of the application using environment variables:

```
# Server Configuration
PORT=8080                     # Port the application will run on
LOG_LEVEL=INFO                # Logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)

# Authentication
DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin  # Default password for the admin user
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key    # Secret key for JWT token generation

# Localization
DEFAULT_LANGUAGE=en           # Default language for new users (en, de)

# Data Initialization
INIT_SAMPLE_DATA=false        # Set to 'true' to initialize with sample data
```

### Port Configuration

By default, the application runs on port 5000 in development mode. You can change this by setting the `PORT` environment variable.

For Docker deployment, you can configure the port in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

## 📱 Usage

### Authentication and User Management

1. **First Login**: The system comes with a default admin user (username: `admin`, password: `admin`)
2. **Password Change**: On first login, you will be required to change the default password
3. **User Management**: Admin users can access the user management interface by clicking the users icon in the header
4. **Creating Users**: Admins can create new users, set permissions, and manage existing accounts
5. **Sharing Filaments**: Users can share their filament collection by clicking the share icon in the header
   - Share all filaments or select specific material types to share
   - Copy the shareable link with one click
   - Shared collections include material/color charts and filtering capabilities
   - Public view doesn't require authentication

### Filament Management

1. **Adding Filaments**: Click the "Add Filament" button to add a new filament to your inventory
2. **Editing Filaments**: Click the edit icon on a filament card to update its details
3. **Filtering**: Use the sidebar filters to find specific filaments by material, manufacturer, or color
4. **Statistics**: View your collection statistics in the statistics accordion
5. **Visualization**: See your material and color distribution in the pie chart

### CSV Resources and Import/Export

Filadex comes with pre-populated CSV files in the `resources` directory that can be used to quickly set up your filament database:

1. **Materials List** (`materials_init.csv`): Contains various filament material types (PLA, PETG, ABS, etc.)
2. **Filament Colors** (`filament_colors_init.csv`): Contains color names and hex codes organized by manufacturer
3. **Vendors List** (`vendors_init.csv`): Contains a list of filament manufacturers/vendors

To use these resources:

1. Navigate to the Settings dialog by clicking the gear icon in the header
2. Find the Import/Export section for the data type you want to import (Materials, Colors, or Manufacturers)
3. Click "Import CSV" and select the corresponding file from the resources directory
4. The application will import the data, skipping any duplicates

You can also export your current data to CSV files for backup or sharing with the community. The community is encouraged to enhance these resource files by adding more materials, colors, and vendors while avoiding duplicate entries.

## 📝 Project Background

The inspiration for Filadex came from BambuLab's announcement of a filament management system. While waiting for their official release, I decided to create an open-source alternative that provides simple management with useful statistics. The project evolved to include user management and self-hosting capabilities, making it a versatile solution for the 3D printing community.

What makes Filadex unique is that it was fully coded with the assistance of AI. This project demonstrates how AI can be leveraged to create functional, well-structured applications while maintaining high code quality and user experience standards.

Now, I'm excited to share Filadex with the community and welcome contributions to make it even better!
